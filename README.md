# SVG Logo Maker

## Task Description

For this task I was asked to create a SVG logo maker in the node.js command line. In order to complete this, I needed to make sure the command line offered:
* The ability to input 3 characters for the log.
* The option to pick a text color.
* The option to pick a shape for the logo between square, circle, and triangle.
* The option to pick a color for the shape.
* For the SVG logo to render itself in the application and be a 300x200 image.
